What is RxJS?

RxJS or Reactive Extensions for JavaScript is a library for transforming, composing, and querying streams of data.
We mean all kinds of data too, from simple arrays of values, to series of events (unfortunate or otherwise), 
to complex flows of data.

Why use it?

Here's a few reasons for choosing RxJS:
> Our emphasis is on queryability and composibility. Consolidating disparate streams into a meaningful whole is a first class story.
> We take a general approach to data. We're not tied to any specific domain. This gives you a common vocabulary for dealing with streams of arbitrary data.
> The dust has settled on our API. RxJS has a history and our API has gone through some hardening.
